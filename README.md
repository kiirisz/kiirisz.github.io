# my website

hi did you know i have a github pages website? it's up there. *all of it*

## the stack

as of right now it's made of the basics (html, css, js), php and sass (because it makes css usable)

## the goal

to showcase my programming prowess, i guess? anyways please have fun browsing through it and do be sure to notify me of any blatant errors in my pretty simple stuff
